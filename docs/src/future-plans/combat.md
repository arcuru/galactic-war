# Combat System

The combat system in Galactic War will be inspired by Inselkampf's tactical approach while incorporating modern improvements and balancing. Combat revolves around fleets of ships attacking and defending solar systems.

## Fleet Composition

### Ship Types

**Frigates** - Main Battle Ships
- Primary combat vessels with strong attack and defense
- Can transport units for ground assault
- Backbone of any assault fleet
- Balanced offensive and defensive capabilities

**Stone Hurlers** - Light Attack Craft  
- Fast, cheap attack ships
- High damage but fragile
- Excellent for raiding undefended systems
- Cost-effective in large numbers

**Lancemen** - Defensive Specialists
- Cannot leave their home system
- Exceptional defensive bonuses when defending
- Critical for system defense
- Fight to the last unit

**Bowmen** - Ranged Attackers
- Powerful attack ships with range advantages
- Excellent for assault fleets
- Weaker in defensive scenarios
- Require tactical positioning

**Cargo Ships** - Support Vessels
- Unarmed transport ships
- Carry resources and supplies
- Essential for raiding operations
- Vulnerable but necessary

**Scout Ships** - Intelligence Gathering
- Fast, stealthy reconnaissance vessels
- Gather intelligence on enemy defenses
- Can slip through defensive lines
- Minimal combat value

**Gun-Toting Warships** - Siege Weapons
- Specialized for destroying structures
- Heavy bombardment capabilities
- Slow but devastating
- Essential for conquest campaigns

**Pioneer Ships** - Colonization Vessels
- Enable colonization of neutral systems
- Must be heavily defended
- Require successful assault to deploy
- Foundation of empire expansion

## Combat Mechanics

### Attack Resolution
Combat follows a deterministic system with some randomness:

1. **Fleet Arrival** - Attacking fleet reaches target system
2. **Defensive Positioning** - Defending units take defensive positions
3. **Combat Rounds** - Multiple rounds of combat occur
4. **Casualty Calculation** - Units are destroyed based on damage taken
5. **Victory Conditions** - Determine success or failure of attack

### Damage Calculation
Each unit type has specific attack and defense values:
- **Attack Power** - Damage dealt to enemy units
- **Defense Rating** - Damage resistance when defending
- **Hit Points** - Amount of damage required to destroy the unit

### Combat Advantages

**Defensive Bonuses:**
- Defending units receive defensive position bonuses
- Barricades provide additional protection
- Lancemen receive enhanced defensive capabilities
- Home system advantage for all defending units

**Fleet Coordination:**
- Mixed fleets perform better than single unit types
- Frigate leadership bonuses for coordinated attacks
- Optimal fleet compositions for different targets

### Battle Outcomes

**Successful Raid:**
- Attacking fleet captures resources
- Cargo ships determine carrying capacity
- Some defending units destroyed
- Attacking fleet may take casualties

**Failed Attack:**
- Attacking fleet destroyed or retreats
- Defending system retains all resources
- Defensive units may take light casualties

**System Conquest:**
- All defending units destroyed
- Pioneer ship successfully lands
- System changes ownership
- Structures may be damaged or destroyed

## Raiding Strategy

### Early Game Raiding
Optimal raid composition for undefended systems:
- 1 Frigate (command and combat)
- 1 Cargo Ship (resource transport)  
- 3 Stone Hurlers (assault force)

Expected casualties: 1 Stone Hurler lost per raid

### Defended System Assault
For systems with defensive units:
- Multiple Frigates for staying power
- Lancemen or Bowmen for assault power
- Scout ships for intelligence
- Cargo ships scaled to expected gains

### Advanced Siege Warfare
For heavily fortified systems:
- Gun-Toting Warships for structure destruction
- Large mixed assault fleet
- Multiple waves of attacks
- Pioneer ship for final colonization

## Defensive Strategy

### Basic Defense
- Build Barricades early
- Train Lancemen for home defense
- Maintain scout ships for early warning
- Prepare defensive fleet positioning

### Advanced Defense
- Layered defensive structures
- Mixed defensive unit composition
- Counter-attack capability
- Alliance coordination for mutual defense

### Intelligence and Early Warning
- Watchtower structures detect incoming fleets
- Scout ship patrols provide advance notice
- Alliance intelligence sharing
- Preparation time for defensive positioning

## Research and Technology

### Combat Research
Research labs will unlock:
- **Bow Technology** - Enables Bowmen production
- **Shield Technology** - Improves defensive capabilities  
- **Spear Technology** - Enhances Lancemen effectiveness
- **Cannon Technology** - Unlocks Gun-Toting Warships

### Unit Upgrades
Technology research improves unit capabilities:
- Increased attack and defense ratings
- Reduced construction costs and times
- Special abilities and tactics
- Advanced ship designs

## Balance Philosophy

The combat system emphasizes:

**Strategic Planning** over quick reflexes
- Battles are resolved automatically
- Success depends on preparation and intelligence
- Long-term strategic thinking rewarded

**Rock-Paper-Scissors Balance**
- No single unit type dominates
- Diverse fleets outperform single-type fleets
- Situational advantages matter

**Defender Advantage**
- Defending is generally stronger than attacking
- Encourages thoughtful expansion
- Prevents endless aggression cycles

**Resource Integration**
- Combat units require continuous resource investment
- Economic strength enables military power
- Balance between growth and military spending

This combat system maintains Inselkampf's tactical depth while adding modern balancing and strategic considerations.
