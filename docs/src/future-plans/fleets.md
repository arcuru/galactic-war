# Fleets and Ships

*This section is under development and will contain detailed information about the planned fleet system.*

## Overview

The fleet system will be the primary means of expansion and conflict in Galactic War. Drawing inspiration from Inselkampf's naval combat, fleets will travel between systems to:

- Colonize unclaimed systems
- Raid enemy systems for resources  
- Scout enemy positions and defenses
- Destroy enemy structures
- Transport resources between your systems

## Ship Types

Details on ship types can be found in the [Combat System](combat.md) page.
