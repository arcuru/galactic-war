# Fleets and Ships

_This section is under development and will contain detailed information about the planned fleet system._

## Overview

The fleet system will be the primary means of expansion and conflict in Galactic War. Drawing inspiration from Inselkampf's naval combat, fleets will travel between systems to:

- Colonize unclaimed systems
- Raid enemy systems for resources
- Scout enemy positions and defenses
- Destroy enemy structures
- Transport resources between your systems

## Ship Types

Details on ship types can be found in the [Combat System](combat.md) page.

## Fleet Management

_Coming soon: Information about fleet composition, management, and strategy._

## Travel and Navigation

_Coming soon: Details about fleet movement, travel times, and navigation systems._
