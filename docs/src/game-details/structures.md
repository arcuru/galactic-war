# Structures

Structures are the buildings you construct in your solar systems. Each structure type serves specific purposes and can be upgraded to higher levels for increased effectiveness.

## Structure Types

### üèõÔ∏è Colony

**The Heart of Your Empire**

The Colony is the central structure of any system and the foundation of your empire.

**Functions:**

- Produces small amounts of all three resources (Metal, Water, Crew)
- Provides storage capacity for resources
- Required for all other construction projects
- Represents the habitability and infrastructure of your system

**Starting Level:** 1 (every system begins with a Colony)

**Strategy Notes:**

- Always upgrade your Colony first in new systems
- Higher-level Colonies enable construction of other structures
- Provides balanced but modest production of all resources

### ‚õèÔ∏è Asteroid Mine

**Metal Production Specialist**

Asteroid Mines extract valuable metals from asteroid fields and planetary deposits.

**Functions:**

- Primary source of Metal production
- Essential for large construction projects
- Scales significantly with upgrades

**Starting Level:** 0 (must be built)

**Strategy Notes:**

- Build early to support construction needs
- Higher levels dramatically increase metal output
- Consider multiple mines in metal-focused systems

### üíß Water Harvester

**Water Collection Facility**

Water Harvesters collect water from comets, ice asteroids, and planetary sources.

**Functions:**

- Primary source of Water production
- Critical for sustaining large populations
- Enables advanced construction projects

**Starting Level:** 0 (must be built)

**Strategy Notes:**

- Essential for crew growth and advanced buildings
- Plan multiple harvesters for water-intensive expansions
- Water often becomes the limiting factor in mid-game

### üë• Hatchery

**Crew Production Center**

Hatcheries accelerate population growth and train specialized personnel.

**Functions:**

- Primary source of Crew production
- Represents population growth and training facilities
- Enables manning of advanced structures and fleets

**Starting Level:** 0 (must be built)

**Strategy Notes:**

- Crew requirements grow exponentially with empire size
- Critical for operating multiple systems
- Build early to support expansion plans

### üì¶ Storage Depot

**Resource Storage Facility**

Storage Depots increase your system's capacity to store resources safely.

**Functions:**

- Dramatically increases storage capacity for all resources
- Protects resources from raids (planned feature)
- Enables stockpiling for major construction projects

**Starting Level:** 0 (must be built)

**Strategy Notes:**

- Build before high-level production structures
- Prevents resource waste from hitting storage caps
- Essential for systems with high production rates

## Structure Mechanics

### Building Process

1. **Resource Check** - Ensure you have sufficient resources
2. **Start Construction** - Resources are consumed immediately
3. **Wait for Completion** - Construction takes time (varies by structure and level)
4. **Automatic Activation** - Structure becomes active when completed

### Upgrade System

- Each structure can be upgraded to higher levels
- Higher levels provide exponentially better benefits
- Upgrade costs increase exponentially with each level
- Formula: `Cost = Base √ó 1.25^(Level-1)`

### Production Scaling

All production structures follow the same scaling pattern:

- **Level 1:** Base production rate
- **Level 2:** Base √ó 1.25 production rate
- **Level 3:** Base √ó 1.25¬≤ production rate
- And so on...

### Multiple Structures

- You can build multiple structures of the same type in one system
- Each structure contributes its full production independently
- Total production = Sum of all structures of that type

## Construction Strategy

### Early System Development

1. **Colony** ‚Üí Level 2-3 (base production and storage)
2. **Storage Depot** ‚Üí Level 1-2 (prevent resource waste)
3. **Specialized Production** ‚Üí Based on system role
4. **Colony** ‚Üí Higher levels (enables advanced construction)

### Resource Specialization

Consider focusing different systems on different resources:

- **Metal Systems:** Multiple Asteroid Mines + Storage
- **Water Systems:** Multiple Water Harvesters + Storage
- **Crew Systems:** Multiple Hatcheries + Storage
- **Balanced Systems:** Mix of all production types

### Timing Considerations

- Construction times increase with structure level
- Plan your build queues to maintain continuous growth
- Consider building multiple lower-level structures vs. one high-level structure
- Balance immediate needs vs. long-term efficiency
