# Introduction

Welcome to **Galactic War**, a casual game of galactic conquest inspired by the classic MMO [Inselkampf](https://ik-seite.de/en/index.php).

## About the Game

Galactic War is a real-time strategy game where you build and manage solar systems in a vast galaxy. Starting with a single colony, you'll expand your empire by:

- **Building structures** to produce resources and expand capabilities
- **Managing resources** (Metal, Water, Crew) to fuel your expansion
- **Colonizing new systems** to grow your galactic empire
- **Strategic planning** as all actions take real time to complete

## Philosophy

Galactic War aims to provide a strategic, long-form gaming experience that respects your time. Unlike many modern games, it's designed for:

- **Thoughtful planning** over constant clicking
- **Long-term strategy** spanning days and weeks
- **Configurable gameplay** allowing different game modes and speeds
- **Open source development** with transparent mechanics and systems

Whether you want a quick blitz game or a months-long campaign, Galactic War adapts to your preferred pace and style.
